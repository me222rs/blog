This week i have tested out some animations and ideas that would fit to the quiz. I do now have a good base to make animations when something is clicked. I have improved the background music button so that i is turning on/off in a better way. I have also added an additional way to get points. You do now get points depending on how fast you give the correct answer, after 10 seconds you will get minus points for being slow. Next week i will try to create a highscore list i think.
