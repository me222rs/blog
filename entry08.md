This week i have refactored the code a bit and added some small features such as more questions, css and bug fixes. I added something so you can see what question you are on which is quite nice. I have also added custom correct-messages for every question which feels more fun and interresting. I still have some refactoring to do, but that i will fix later this week. I should also clear the database from crap. I did also get a pull request where someone refactored the audioplayer for me which made the code a little easier to read. I have also moved all the questions to a separate file which feels better than having the questions in initialstate.
