This week i have started to refactor the code and added firebase to my highscore list. I have removed almost all of the document.getElementById() and replaced it with better code. I have also fixed the music so that it will no longer autoplay and the volume will not break your ears. Next thing to do is to filter out some names in the highscore list and make sure you cannot post more than once a game. Some styling should also be added to the highscore page.
