This week i havn't done a lot on the javascript project due to having other stuff to do, but next week i should have almost double time for the project. I did some minor changes like changing from storing the questions and answers in an three different arrays to an array with objects instead. I Also added some background music for the game. The music might be a little to loud so keep that in mind if you want to try the game.
